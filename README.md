Prompt: You will create twenty records, each record containing the following fields: student name, class: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior or Senir, Major: liberal Arts or Genreal Science and ten randomly generated test scores between 0 and 100. You will also incorporate the following calculated fields into your record: mean, median, mode and standard deviation. Once each record is prepared properly you will inert it into a structore so that the list of students can be printed in ascending order by standard deviation. After you display the records write them to a file.

I used c++ in this project.
